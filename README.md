# Villein-Clock
The app is a clock based on the Villein numerical system and their glyphs from the game Obduction.
It displays the time in minutes of a 24 hour day ((Hours * 60min) + Minutes) and the second hand in red.
If you click on the diamond outer ring you can drag to reposition the app, sadly to close you have to right click the icon on the taskbar and close that way but aesthetics are important!
Included here is my cypher I made to simplify reading and writing numbers back when i played through the game.
Enjoy!
